READ ME


All of the ideas behind the examples in this project WERE NOT created by me. I worked through 
Pluralsight's "Design Patterns in Java" courses to brush up on all the patterns. These courses were
created and narrated by Bryan Hansen. I have made changes to the demos to better suit my learning and 
show this was not just copy/paste. I created and typed all the working code off the demos but
the core ideas ARE NOT mine. The goal was to show I have spent many hours learning and internalizing 
the patterns and apply them to "real world" situations to further my skills as a professional developer. 

Thank you.
